Welcome to CHEOPS, an AI chess engine.

CHEOPS is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

The doc subdirectory contains a Unix man page describing how to use
CHEOPS.  There is also a LaTeX file (preprocessed into DVI and PDF
formats) which contains the text of the man page plus information of
interest to programmers wishing to understand or extend CHEOPS.  Only
the man page is installed by default.

For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.
