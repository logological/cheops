CHEOPS
======

**[CHEOPS](https://logological.org/cheops)** (CHEss OPponent
Simulator) is a fully-functional chess program capable of
human-vs-human, human-vs-computer, and computer-vs-computer play. It
uses a 64-square linear array board representation. The game tree
search is alphaâ€“beta, and the static evaluation function considers
material, mobility, and motif features.
