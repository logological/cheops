.SH SYNOPSIS
  cheops [\-\-help] [\-\-version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Cheops (CHEss OPponent Simulator) is a fully-functional chess program
capable of human-vs-human, human-vs-computer, and computer-vs-computer
play.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH GAMEPLAY
Once invoked, CHEOPS displays a title screen and prompts the user for
who controls each player. If a computer opponent is chosen, a list of
default static evaluation function weights is displayed.  To accept
the default values, type \fBdone\fR; otherwise, enter the number of
the weight to change. The program will then prompt for the new value.
The program will allow the user to adjust the weights until \fBdone\fR
is entered.
.P
Following player setup, the board is displayed and the game begins.
The board is represented by a simple text diagram using the standard
one-character piece abbreviations; white pieces are represented by
small letters and black pieces by capitals.  Each player makes his
move in turn; human players are prompted for their move, and computer
players move automatically. To make a move, enter the source and
destination coordinates in standard algebraic notation -- for example,
\fBg1f3\fR moves the knight at g1 to f3.  For pawn promotions, the
promotion piece must be appended -- for instance, \fBe7e8n\fR promotes
to a knight. For castling, the user may either enter the source and
destination coordinates of the king, or he may simply type \fBo-o\fR
or \fBo-o-o\fR for kingside or queenside castling, respectively. The
players may continue entering moves in this manner until a checkmate
or draw state is reached. As in regular chess, a draw occurs upon
stalemate, triple observance of the same board configuration with the
same side to move, or observance of fifty moves without a capture or
pawn advance.
.P
In addition to legal moves, the following commands are also available
as responses for human players. At the end of a game, no further moves
are possible, and one of these commands must be entered.
